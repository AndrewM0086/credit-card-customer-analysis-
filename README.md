## About Project


### Business Problems


- Finding customer segmentation in business is so important to find out which classification of customers has an impact on the business's growth.
- In this project, we will segment credit card customers with a clustering method so that the business team can map classification customers to find out the characteristics of customers who contribute to business growth.
- Open source data from kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata)



### Data Solution


- Facilitating customer mapping segmentation with a clustering model
- Creating a machine learning model (**Kmeans**) to do clustering of credit card users
- Evaluating the model with deep learning (**Autoencoder**) for improved clustering accuracy
- presented the results of cluster modeling by categorizing customer segments so that the business team can map customers.



### Steps Project


- Data preparation, cleaning, and processing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Transfrom Data
- Running **machine learning model with kmeans**
- Visualizing the model with **PCA(Principal Compenent Analysis)**
- Evaluate with the **Deep Learning Autoencoder**
- evaluation model
- Visualizing Clustering
- Business Insight
